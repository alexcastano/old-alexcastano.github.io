Welcome to my new development blog:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hello_world(name)
  puts "Hello world, #{name}!"
end

print_hello_world(visitor.name)
{% endhighlight %}



In this blog I'll write about the projects I'm working, and about languages and technologies I like to use.

I learned a lot from the community for a long time, so I thought it is my moment to share. And who knows? Maybe you find something useful here :)

Thanks for reading

ZZ
