Hi there!

My name is Alex Casta√±o. I am a very curious person and I love creating awesome things.
For this very reason I ended up becoming a happy developer, a bad designer, an amateur marketer, a crazy accountant or just another entrepeneur.

I live in Seville (Spain) and I enjoy traveling and playing sports in my free time.

If you want to contact me you can do it in the email: alexcastanodev@gmail.com
